        <p id="instructionText">Welcome to Nibsplosion! The knock-off version of Space Invaders- I mean a totally original game! <br>
            Nibbles (my favourite stuffed animal) embarked on a journey in space in his mission to conquer the world. <br>
            Unfortunately, Snorlax - the world's guardian, cannot allow Nibbles to go against the balance or law of casuality <br>
            that has been holding the world together for years! <br>
            Help Nibbles dodge Snorlax's attacks and fight back!<br>
            [Unfortunately Nibbles is a lot weaker than Snorlax - him being a deity and all, so try holding back for as long as possible :)]
