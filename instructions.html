        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Nibsplosion! The knock-off version of Space Invaders- I mean a totally original game! <br>
            Nibbles (my favourite stuffed animal) embarked on a journey in space in his mission to conquer the world. <br>
            Unfortunately, snorlax - the world's guardian, cannot allow Nibbles to go against the balance or law of casuality <br>
            that has been holding the world together for years! <br>
            Help Nibbles dodge Snorlax's attacks and fight back!<br>
            (Unfortunately Nibbles is a lot weaker than Snorlax - him being a deity and all, so try holding back for as long as possible :) )
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Press 'd' to move right
                </li>
                <li>
                    Press 'a' to move left
                </li>
                <li>
                    Press SPACE key to shoot
                </li>
                <li>
                    When Nibbles is hit, the game will end
                </li>
                <li>
                    Snorlax has a special skill, which allows him to make duplicates of itself at random times, and then dissapear like a mirage
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
